1.- Known bugs:
    When you are "painting" with clicked mouse, if you change window and
    unclick outside the page, the pen goes on painting. We should add an event
    to cause call mouseUp when changing window
2.- I'll deviate from the assignment with a different pen behaviour: painting 
    over already painted should have an influence on the saturation 
    rather than on the light. Then, hue and light would be the random
    parameters
3.- Improve hueSum, satSum as for the comments
