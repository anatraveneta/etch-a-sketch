1.- Improve UI at least for a minimum: Tell a story like the app 
    allows you to simulate painting on stained glass. Some nice pictures
    of samples from cathedrals or the like will help.
    
2.- In a later version, allow control over stroke weight, hue and saturation
    instead of putting random or fixed parameters. In this case, treat
    the grey scale in a different way: allow to select achromatic as hue.
    The saturation is determined by (100 - light) and strokeWeight ponderates
    the former
