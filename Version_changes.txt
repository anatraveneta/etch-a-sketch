Improve solution to the two previous bugs

These known bus were drag problem and mouseUp out of focus problem.
They subsisted in the area below the grid container.

* First point
In the previous attempt, we tried to fix the drag bug by adding a
draggable="false" attribute at div level. Without success.


Then we thought we had solved it by adding
the following code at <body> level in the html file:

ondragstart="return false;" ondrop="return false;"

This fixed the bug when dragging on the grid container, in the 
lateral espace around it or above it.

Both pieces of code were found on stock overflow:

Then, we realized that dragging was still allowed
in the bottom of the page, below the grid container. So we moved the 
code at html level:

<html lang="en" draggable="false"
    ondragstart="return false;" ondrop="return false;">

The event listener was also moved from body element to window.
The mouseDown function has been modified to sort out triggering
from the window.

This fixed both problems.
